Feature: Vision Framework Architecture
  As a Vision AI developer
  I want a well-structured PyTorch Lightning framework
  So that I can easily develop vision models

  Background:
    Given the vision framework is properly initialized
    And all required dependencies are available

  Scenario: Base Vision Model Creation
    Given I have the framework architecture
    When I create a new vision model class
    Then it should inherit from the BaseVisionModel class
    And it should support common vision tasks
    And it should have proper PyTorch Lightning integration

  Scenario: ResNet Classification Model Registration
    Given the model registry is available
    When I register a ResNet classification model
    Then the model should be successfully registered
    And it should be accessible by name "resnet"
    And it should support all ResNet variants

  Scenario: Model Configuration and Initialization
    Given a valid model configuration
    When I initialize a vision model with the configuration
    Then the model should be created successfully
    And it should have the correct number of classes
    And it should use the specified backbone architecture
    And the model parameters should be properly initialized

  Scenario: Model Training Components
    Given an initialized vision model
    When I examine the model components
    Then it should have a backbone network
    And it should have a task-specific head
    And it should have appropriate loss function
    And it should have configured metrics
    And it should have optimizer configuration

  Scenario: Model Forward Pass
    Given an initialized vision model
    And a sample input tensor
    When I perform a forward pass
    Then the output should have the correct shape
    And the output should be a valid tensor
    And no gradients should be lost during forward pass

  Scenario: Model Training Step
    Given an initialized vision model in training mode
    And a batch of training data
    When I perform a training step
    Then the loss should be computed correctly
    And metrics should be updated
    And gradients should be computed
    And training logs should be generated

  Scenario: Model Validation Step
    Given an initialized vision model in evaluation mode
    And a batch of validation data
    When I perform a validation step
    Then the validation loss should be computed
    And validation metrics should be updated
    And no gradients should be computed
    And validation logs should be generated

  Scenario: Model Backbone Freezing
    Given an initialized vision model
    When I freeze the backbone parameters
    Then backbone parameters should have requires_grad=False
    And head parameters should have requires_grad=True
    And frozen parameters should not update during training

  Scenario: Model Metrics Setup
    Given a vision model configuration for classification
    When I setup the model metrics
    Then it should have accuracy metrics for training and validation
    And it should have F1 score metrics
    And metrics should be properly initialized
    And metrics should reset between epochs

  Scenario: Model Hooks Registration
    Given an initialized vision model
    When I register custom hooks
    Then hooks should be properly registered
    And hooks should execute at the correct time
    And multiple hooks can be registered for the same event

  Scenario: Model Summary Generation
    Given an initialized vision model
    When I generate a model summary
    Then it should display model architecture
    And it should show parameter counts
    And it should show layer information
    And the summary should be properly formatted
