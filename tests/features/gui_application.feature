    When I navigate to the training control widget
    Then I should see start/stop training buttons
    And I should see training progress indicators
    And I should see epoch and batch progress
    And the controls should be properly enabled/disabled

  Scenario: Metrics Visualization Widget
    Given the main window is displayed
    When I navigate to the metrics visualization widget
    Then I should see real-time training plots
    And I should see loss curves
    And I should see accuracy metrics
    And the plots should update automatically

  Scenario: Log Viewer Widget
    Given the main window is displayed
    When I navigate to the log viewer widget
    Then I should see training logs
    And I should see different log levels
    And I should see timestamps
    And logs should be properly formatted

  Scenario: Experiment Tracker Widget
    Given the main window is displayed
    When I navigate to the experiment tracker widget
    Then I should see experiment history
    And I should see experiment metadata
    And I should see model artifacts
    And experiments should be searchable

  Scenario: Settings Dialog
    Given the main window is displayed
    When I open the settings dialog
    Then I should see application preferences
    And I should see path configurations
    And I should see theme options

    And I should see version details
    And I should see license information
    And the dialog should be properly formatted

  Scenario: Training Workflow Integration
    Given the GUI application is running
    When I configure a training session
    And I start the training process
    Then the training should begin in a separate thread
    And the GUI should remain responsive
    And progress should be displayed in real-time
    And I should be able to stop training

  Scenario: Error Handling and User Feedback
    Given the GUI application is running
    When an error occurs during operation
    Then the error should be displayed to the user
    And the application should remain stable
    And appropriate error messages should be shown

  Scenario: Window State Management
    Given the GUI application is running
    When I resize or move windows
    Then the window state should be preserved
    And the layout should adapt properly
    And widget sizes should adjust accordingly
    And the state should persist between sessions

  Scenario: Keyboard Shortcuts and Accessibility
    Given the GUI application is running
    When I use keyboard shortcuts
